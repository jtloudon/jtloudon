## Featured Projects

### [GoalWhisperer AI](https://github.com/jtloudon/goalwhisperer-ai)
**AI-powered OKR tracking with conversational interface**

Demonstrates systematic approach to goal achievement using LLM-based coaching and structured data management. Reduces friction through voice-enabled AI interface—enabling natural conversation instead of manual data entry for consistent progress tracking.

Built to solve the same challenge I address professionally: maintaining momentum on complex, multi-dimensional transformation initiatives.

**Tech Stack:** React + Node.js + Claude Sonnet 4.5 | **Architecture:** Local-first with markdown-based data layer
