# 👋 Hi, I'm Jesse Loudon

I work on AI governance, evaluation, and analytics in financial services - bridging technical AI implementation with business outcomes and regulatory compliance.

- Build AI governance frameworks and LLM evaluation methodologies for GenAI applications
- Specialize in AWS Bedrock RAG systems, LLM-as-a-Judge approaches, and human-in-the-loop processes
- Develop analytics dashboards and OKR systems for transformation initiatives
- Focus on making GenAI safe and effective in regulated industries (NIST AI RMF compliance)

Currently exploring: Classification frameworks for AI risk management | Continuous evaluation patterns for banking RAG applications
